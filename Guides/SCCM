1. Deploying PowerShell Scripts via SCCM
Step 1: Preparing the Environment
Before you start, ensure that:

SCCM is correctly installed and configured in your environment.
You have appropriate permissions to create packages and deploy them.
The target machines have PowerShell execution policies configured to allow the scripts to run. The RemoteSigned execution policy is recommended.

Step 2: Creating a Package and Program
Creating the Package
Open SCCM Console: Launch the SCCM Console and navigate to Software Library > Application Management > Packages.
Create a New Package:
Right-click on Packages and choose Create Package.
Enter a name for the package (e.g., "Security Patch Scripts").
Set the source folder where your PowerShell scripts are stored.
Configure any additional properties if needed, such as version or manufacturer.
Click Next to proceed to the next step.
Creating the Program
Define the Program:

In the Program Type step, choose Standard Program.
Name the program (e.g., "Deploy Security Scripts").
In the Command line field, use the following command:
plaintext
Copy code
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "scriptname.ps1"
Replace "scriptname.ps1" with the actual name of your script.
Specify that the program should run with administrative rights.
Configure Additional Options:

Under Requirements, set conditions like minimum memory, disk space, or operating system versions if necessary.
In Environment, ensure the program runs in a logged-on user context, or choose Whether or not a user is logged on to run it as a system context.
Set the estimated disk space and maximum run time (if applicable).
Specify Program Behavior:

In the Program Can Run section, choose Only when no user is logged on if you want to minimize user disruption.
Decide if the program should run as a background process.
Complete the Wizard:

After setting up the program, click Next and Close to finalize the package creation.

Step 3: Distributing the Package
Distribute Content:

Right-click on the newly created package and select Distribute Content.
Choose the distribution points or distribution point groups where the content should be made available.
Review the distribution status to ensure content is successfully distributed.
Deploy the Package:

Right-click on the package and select Deploy.
Choose the Device Collection that includes the target machines.
Configure the deployment settings, such as making it a Required deployment and setting the deadline (e.g., "As Soon As Possible").
Under User Experience, decide whether to display notifications to users.
Monitoring: Once deployed, monitor the deployment status under Monitoring > Deployments to track success and resolve any issues.

Step 4: Monitoring and Reporting
Use the Monitoring workspace in SCCM to view the deployment status, errors, and logs.
Generate reports to review how many machines successfully executed the scripts and identify any failures.
Best Practices
Testing: Always test the package and program on a small collection or in a lab environment before wide deployment.
Logs: Review logs in C:\Windows\CCM\Logs (e.g., execmgr.log) on client machines to troubleshoot any issues.
