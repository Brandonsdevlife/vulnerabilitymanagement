Deploying PowerShell Scripts via Intune

Step 1: Preparing the Environment
Before deploying scripts via Intune:

Ensure that devices are enrolled in Intune.
Confirm that you have the necessary admin permissions in the Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center.

Step 2: Creating and Uploading the Script
Uploading the Script
Access the Intune Portal:

Navigate to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center (https://endpoint.microsoft.com).
Go to Devices > Scripts > Add.
Configure the Script Settings:

Choose Windows 10 and later as the platform.
Upload your .ps1 file.
Configure the script settings:
Run this script using the logged-on credentials: Set to No if the script needs admin rights.
Enforce script signature check: Set to No unless you are using signed scripts.
Run script in 64-bit PowerShell Host: Choose Yes if applicable.
Assign the Script:

Under Assignments, choose the device groups or all devices that should run the script.
Click Next to review the settings and then Add to deploy the script.

Step 3: Monitoring the Deployment
Monitoring: After deployment, monitor the status in Devices > Scripts. You can see which devices ran the script successfully and troubleshoot any failures.
Best Practices
Testing: Test the script on a pilot group before deploying it across all devices.
Compliance Policies: Ensure compliance policies are configured to enforce the script's effects if needed.
